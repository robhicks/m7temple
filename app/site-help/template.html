    <h1>Why This Site?</h1>
    <p>
      There are a lot of reasons we don't work on Temple and Family History work. Some include: 1)
      I don't know where to start, 2) The amount of work needing to be done is overwhelming, 3)
      It's all done on computers and I don't get a long all well with computers, 4 I'm too busy,
      5) My work is all done, 6) I'll do it when I get older, and 6) It's too hard ...
      you get the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site exists to help you get help make doing temple and family history work a little easier.
      While it can't help with all of the reasons, it can help with some. It is a place to sign up
      for small tasks (or skills), get help doing them and then helping others with those tasks (or skills).
